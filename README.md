# Genetic-Birds-Simulator
A simulation of birds using neural networks and a genetic algorithm.

## About
### Motivation
This project follows [MLP-Digits-Recognition](), an implementation of a neural network from scratch. This time, I used [this great tutorial](https://pwy.io/posts/learning-to-fly-pt1/) as a starting point, to train the neural network with a genetic algorithm, instead of backpropagation.
